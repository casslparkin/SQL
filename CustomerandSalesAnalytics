In this project I worked with multiple tables to answer the following questions:

How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6;

How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
and length(orderid) = 6;

Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
Select distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
Inner JOIN BiT_DB.FebSales Feb
On cust.order_id=Feb.orderid
Where length(orderid)=6;

Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
Select distinct Product, price 
From BIT_DB.Jansales
Order by price asc Limit 1;

What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
Select round (sum(quantity)*price,2) as Revenue, Product
From Bit_DB.JanSales
Group By Product;

Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
Select Product,sum(Quantity), sum(Quantity)*price as Revenue
From Bit_DB.FebSales
Where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
Group by Product;

How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
Select count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)  
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
Inner Join BIT_DB.Febsales Feb
On Cust.order_id=Feb.orderID
Where Feb.Quantity >2
AND length (orderid)=6;

List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product
